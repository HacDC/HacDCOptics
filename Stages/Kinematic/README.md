Real kinematic mount. Groove at top-right, point-contact at top-left, conical contact at bottom.

Preload can be provided by rubber band. Grease and rough (~800grit) polishing of some surfaces may improve performance.

Base plate can be used alone as a plain mount for subsequent stages (eg. lens mount) if precise angular alignment is not required.
